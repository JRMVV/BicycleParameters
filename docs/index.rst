==================================
BicycleParameters's documentation!
==================================

The ``bicycleparameters package`` is a python program designed to produce and
manipulate the basic parameters needed for basic bicycle dynamic models.

Description
===========
This is code based off of the work done to measure the physical parameters
of a bicycle and rider at both the `UCD Sports Biomechanics Lab`_ and the `TU
Delft Bicycle Dynamics Lab`_. Physical parameters include but are not limited
to the geometry, mass, mass location and mass distribution of the bicycle rider
system. The code is structured around the Whipple bicycle model and
fundamentally works with and produces the parameters presented in Meijaard
2007, due to the fact that these parameters have been widely adopted as a
benchmark. More detail can be found in our papers and the website_.

Features
========

Parameter Manipulation
----------------------

- Loads bicycle parameter sets from a text file into a python object.
- Generates the benchmark parameter set for a real bicycle from experimental
  data.
- Loads a rider from a parameter set.
- Generates the rider parameter set from human measurements based on the Yeadon
  model configured to sit on the bicycle.
- Plots a descriptive drawing of the bicycle or rider.

Basic Linear Analysis
---------------------

- Calculates the A and B matrices for the Whipple bicycle model linearized
  about the upright configuration.
- Calculates the canonical matrices for the Whipple bicycle model linearized
  about the upright configuration.
- Calculates the eigenvalues for the Whipple bicycle model linearized about the
  upright configuration.
- Plots the eigenvalue root loci as a function of speed, both in the complex
  plane and as eigenvalue vs speed.

Upcoming Features
=================

- Converts benchmark parameters to other parametrizations
- Calculates the transfer functions of the open loop system.
- Plots Bode diagrams of the open loop transfer functions.
- Generates publication quality tables of parameters using LaTeX
